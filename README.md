# ShowMeTv.
> Browse TV shows and add them to your watchlist

The purpose of this assignment is to showcase my familiarity with frontend technologies, programming patterns and what clean and reusable code means to the me as a developer.
I have used the TV shows API http://www.tvmaze.com/api to create an application that allows users to browse TV shows and add them to their watchlist.
